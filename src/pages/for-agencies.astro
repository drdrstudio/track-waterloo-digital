				<h2>The Career-Killing Truth Nobody Talks About</h2>
				<p>You just ran a campaign that drove $200k in revenue for your client.</p>
				<p>Facebook says it drove $50k. Google claims $30k. Your client sees the bank deposit but has no idea it came from your ads.</p>
				<p><strong>Result?</strong> Your "underperforming" campaign gets killed. Your contract gets questioned. Your best work gets blamed for their worst results.</p>
				<p><strong>Meanwhile,</strong> that terrible campaign that's actually losing money? It's getting full credit for organic sales that would have happened anyway.</p>
				<p style="font-size: 1.25rem; font-weight: 600; margin-top: 2rem;">You're not getting fired for being bad at ads. You're getting fired for having bad attribution.</p>

				<h2>You're Leaving Money on the Table (A Lot of It)</h2>
				<div style="display: grid; gap: 20px; margin: 30px 0;">
					<div style="padding: 20px; background: white; border-radius: 8px;">
						<p>• Your winning campaigns look like losers (so you kill them)</p>
					</div>
					<div style="padding: 20px; background: white; border-radius: 8px;">
						<p>• Your losing campaigns look like winners (so you scale them)</p>
					</div>
					<div style="padding: 20px; background: white; border-radius: 8px;">
						<p>• Your client can't connect their revenue to your work</p>
					</div>
					<div style="padding: 20px; background: white; border-radius: 8px;">
						<p>• You can't prove your value when contract renewal comes up</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p style="font-size: 1.25rem; margin-top: 2rem;"><strong>But here's the bigger problem:</strong></p>
				<p>Every client you lose to "performance issues" represents $500-2000/month in recurring revenue you'll never see again.</p>
				<p><strong>If broken attribution costs you just 2 clients per year, that's $24k in lost recurring revenue. Forever.</strong></p>

				<h2>What If Every Client Became a Revenue Partner?</h2>
				<p>Here's what most agencies miss: <strong>Attribution isn't just about proving your current work. It's about creating a new recurring revenue stream.</strong></p>
				<p>When you solve attribution for a client, you don't just save the account. You create a monthly revenue share opportunity.</p>
				
				<div style="background: #f8f9fa; padding: 40px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 40px 0;">
					<h3>The Partnership Model:</h3>
					<p><strong>Your client pays for the attribution platform. You get recurring commission. Forever.</strong></p>
					
					<div style="margin: 30px 0;">
						<p style="font-size: 1.25rem;"><strong>The math:</strong> $500-1000/month per client in recurring revenue. No additional work. No additional overhead.</p>
						<p style="font-size: 1.5rem; color: #7cd3d2; font-weight: 700; margin-top: 20px;">10 clients × $750/month = $7,500 in recurring revenue.</p>
						<p style="font-size: 1.25rem;">That's $90k/year in passive income from your existing client base.</p>

				<h2>The Partnership Questions Every Agency Asks</h2>
				
				<div style="display: grid; gap: 30px; margin-top: 40px;">
					<div style="padding: 25px; background: #f8f9fa; border-radius: 8px;">
						<h3 style="color: #7cd3d2; margin-bottom: 10px;">"How much recurring revenue can I actually make?"</h3>
						<p>$500-1000/month per client depending on their size. 20 clients = $10k-20k/month in recurring revenue. That's $120-240k/year in mostly passive income.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div style="padding: 25px; background: #f8f9fa; border-radius: 8px;">
						<h3 style="color: #7cd3d2; margin-bottom: 10px;">"Do my clients need to know about the partnership?"</h3>
						<p>Up to you. We offer white-label options where clients think it's your proprietary solution. Or you can be transparent about the partnership. Both models work.</p>

					<div style="padding: 25px; background: #f8f9fa; border-radius: 8px;">

						<p>Easy conversation: "I found a way to see exactly which of our campaigns are driving your revenue. Want to take a look?" Most clients say yes immediately.</p>
