				<h2>Your Attribution is Probably Broken</h2>
				<p>iOS updates, privacy laws, and ad blockers have created blind spots in every marketing stack. You're making million-dollar decisions with about 70% of the data.</p>

						<h3 style="color: #7cd3d2; margin-bottom: 10px;">Missing Conversions</h3>
						<p style="margin: 0;">30% of your customers are invisible to your tracking. They're buying, but your platforms can't see them.</p>
					</div>
					<div style="padding: 25px; background: #f8f9fa; border-radius: 8px;">
						<h3 style="color: #7cd3d2; margin-bottom: 10px;">False Attribution</h3>
						<p style="margin: 0;">Platforms take credit for conversions they didn't drive. Your worst campaigns look like winners.</p>

					<div style="padding: 25px; background: #f8f9fa; border-radius: 8px;">
